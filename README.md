This program connects to OSU's official [Students V1 API]([url](https://developer.oregonstate.edu/api/3)), pulling data about each student's classification (grade level),
department affiliations, and more.

To run this program, you must first be authenticated through OSU services and generate your personal API Key & Secret. DO NOT SHARE THESE KEYS WITH ANYONE.
To be safe, create a .env file within your cloned project repositry and store them there.

For questions or assistance, feel free to reach out to Noam Yaffe (yaffen@oregonstate.edu) or Havel Konda (kondah@oregonstate.edu).
